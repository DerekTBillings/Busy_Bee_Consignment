<p>About</p>
<p>Busy Bee Consignment & Boutique is located in Yorktown VA, in the beautiful subdivision of Kiln Creek. We are minutes away from Interstate 64 and right next to tons of restaurants. We consign and sell new and gently used children's clothing 0-7/8. Busy Bee is very kid friendly with a "kids area" that's filled with games, books, and a TV to keep those "busy bees" busy while mom or dad shop around! You are guaranteed to find some great bargains for yourself or if you are buying for an expectant mom. Many of our new items such as boutique bows, blankets, crochet hats, and burp cloths are made local. We also offer embroidery for a small fee on any of our boutique items, or items that you bring in! </p>
<p>We accept kids clothes sized Newborn through 7/8. All clothing MUST be freshly washed, clean, current style, and put in a bag with your name and phone number on the bag. We accept 50 items at a time. We do not accept socks and underwear. We also accept books that have no writing, spine must not be torn or cracked, and all pages must be intact. DVDS can have no scratches and should be in the original case. Games should be in the original box, have instructions, and have ALL pieces. Toys must be in working order with working batteries, and not older than 5 years. We will not accept anything that has been recalled! If you have any questions about anything listed that you are unsure of, feel free to give us a call and our staff will help you.</p>
<p>All consigners must complete and sign our Consignment Contract when you drop off for the first time. You will be given a copy of your contract as well.</p>
